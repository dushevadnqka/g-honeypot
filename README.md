## Hi Paul!

### This is my implementation for the task.

## Install:

1. Prerequisits:
    - docker
    - docker compose

2. It's assumed you already cloned the project and reached itcin your console.

3. Let's first create an `.env` file from the `.env.dist`:
    ```
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```
4. Go to the new `.env` file and take in consideration the ports which would be used and how this would deal with some configs at your host machine.

5.
